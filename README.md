#  AudioFlow

## Introduction

  This proof of concept uses Lens Protocol to allow users to create their profile (if they dont have any), post audio files as lens publications and also donate tokens to users by using superfluid protocol. The audio content is uploaded to IPFS by using web3.storage api and also the user ipfs node in his browser. 
  
  
## How it works

  - User login in the dapp using his wallet and connect to the lens protocol;
  - If he has not a lens profile, he will be allowed to create one at "Profile" page;
  - Once user publish a content this is uploaded to IPFS by using web3.storage api, which will allow that content to be pined by other ipfs nodes by using filecoin;
  - Users can explore others music posts in the "Explore" page, where they can donate to the publication owners by streaming tokens using superfluid protocol;
