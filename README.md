# Music_Sharing_Social_Network

The Lens social graph has the power to revolutionize the music experience for both fans and artists. Fans will have new ways to discover music, find like minded fans, and experience music together. Artists will have new ways to deepen their fan connection, and new options for commercializing their creations.

Most artists struggle to make a viable living on todayâ€™s platforms, due to the highly competitive nature of being seen on those platforms, and the debilitating fees involved, with $0.88 of every revenue dollar going to stakeholders other than the artist. Releasing content on-chain opens up new possibilities for monetization.
